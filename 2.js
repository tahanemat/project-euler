// Even Fibonacci numbers
   
// Problem 2

// Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

// 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

// By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

let myArr = [1,2];

let sum = 2; // starting with sum being the first even number

while(myArr[1] < 4000000){
    let nextNum = myArr[0] + myArr[1];

    if(nextNum % 2 == 0){
        sum += nextNum;
    }

    myArr.push(nextNum);
    myArr.shift();
}

console.log(sum); // Answer: 4613732
